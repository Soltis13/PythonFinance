## Installation Notes

### Anaconda

    Add Anaconda PATH to environment variable
            
### XAMPP
    https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
    
    setting up a local test server on your computer relatively easy. It provides the (W)AMP stack - Apache, MySQL, and PHP. It also includes PHPMyAdmin which is very useful for dealing with your MySQL databases.
    
    localhost/dashboard
    
    Install WordPress : Then, in Windows, navigate to the folder where you installed XAMPP. For me, that’s C://xampp. It should be something similar for you. Then, in that folder, find the htdocs subfolder:
    In htdocs, create a new folder for your test site. This folder name will become the sub-name used to access your site. For example, if you make the folder testsite, you’ll access your site by going to http://localhost/testsite.

    Once you create the folder, extract the WordPress .zip file you downloaded from wordpress.org into it:
    
    Next, you need to create a MySQL database for your WordPress install. To do that, launch PHPMyAdmin from your XAMPP control panel:
    Then click on Databases at the top:
    And enter a name for your database and click Create. Your name can be anything – just remember it because you’ll need it for the next step:
    Unlike installing WordPress on a live web server, when you install XAMPP and WordPress, you don’t need to worry about creating a database user.
    When you visit your test site, you should see the normal WordPress installer. Remember, your test site is just http://localhost/FOLDERNAME:
    The only step where this process will differ from a normal install is the database details. When you get to the database details, enter them like this:

    Database Name = Name of the database you created in PHPMyAdmin
    Username = “root”
    Password = leave blank
